In fact, according to the 2016 Breach Level Index report, there were 974 reported incidents of data breaches, with 728 of them occurring in the United States alone, resulting in the loss of millions of confidential documents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This alarming figure raises a lot of questions, one of which is whether companies are doing their level best to protect customer information and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, and why they should do so. Here are some benefits and risks all companies need to be aware of, and that I think should be a motivator to tighten up your application security immediately.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="923" height="315" src="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-security-software.png?fit=923%2C315&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="ecommerce website development companies in bangalore, ecommerce developers bangalore" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-security-software.png?w=923&amp;ssl=1 923w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-security-software.png?resize=300%2C102&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-security-software.png?resize=768%2C262&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-security-software.png?resize=600%2C205&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Benefits:</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Safety and Security of Confidential Information</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The safety and security of sensitive information is a primary concern for many individuals. This is one of the major reasons why many are hesitant to share personal information online.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To remove this negative stigma, many companies go to huge lengths to assure customers that their information is safe with them. The online retail business and credit card industry are prime examples of this.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the growing trend of online shopping, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) has enforced a set of guidelines and security measures to limit instances of credit card fraud and make the process of online transactions safe. This added security measure has helped the companies in this industry grow, but there is always that question of whether they doing enough.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1217" height="505" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?fit=1217%2C505&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="web design services in bangalore, mobile app development company Bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?w=1217&amp;ssl=1 1217w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C319&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=1024%2C425&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=1140%2C473&amp;ssl=1 1140w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/web-design-services-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C249&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sound Market Reputation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this day and age where companies are being affected by cyberattackers left and right, it is somewhat of a luxury to be safe from such occurrences. However, those who manage to do so have reaped the rewards in terms of the number of customers they serve, sales they make and reputation they have earned as a result of their best-in-industry practices.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1571" height="689" src="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?fit=1571%2C689&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="responsive web development company Bangalore, digital marketing and web development company in Bangalore" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?w=1571&amp;ssl=1 1571w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C337&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=1024%2C449&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=1140%2C500&amp;ssl=1 1140w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/website-designing-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C263&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Risks:</strong></h3><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lawsuits</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The data breach, or any other form of loss of personal and confidential information, is a serious matter that could land a company in a lot of trouble.
