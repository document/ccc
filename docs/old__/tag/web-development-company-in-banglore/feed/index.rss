This website is suitable for unedited organizations.<br /> The static website is always showing the same pages to the clients, even we can add multimedia files like images and videos. However, this static website always welcomes the clients with the same contents and images until we alter the page source code.</p><h2>Dynamic Websites</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In a dynamic website, we change the content dynamically while the page is running on the client browser. These websites using server-side programming languages like PHP,Asp.net and JSP etc. We can change the contents at the runtime. Dynamic websites using server-side code to handle events, it manages session and cookies, and it will store and retrieve data from the database. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic websites</a> are mainly used for e-commerce websites, online form applications, social networking sites, Regular updating sites etc.<br /> A dynamic website has the capacity of showing different content for different visitors from the same source code.

Responsive designs are giving more attractive to the dynamic websites. Its suitable for all devices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone Should know the <a href="https://www.cairocorps.com/benefits-of-responsive-web-design-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of responsive web design</a>.
