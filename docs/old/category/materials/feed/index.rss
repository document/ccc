Effective marketing demands it.SEO is a collection of tools and best practices that help your website rank higher in search engine results, thereby driving more traffic to your site and potentially more business.</p><p><span id="more-2542"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, although SEO once involved adding keywords to your site for search engines to find, SEO in 2018 is far more complex and involves a much broader scope of considerations. Nowadays SEO is a full-time job for small businesses and many are turning to website design and marketing experts such as Pronto for support.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_video_widget wpb_content_element vc_clearfix   vc_video-aspect-ratio-169 vc_video-el-width-100 vc_video-align-left"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="wpb_video_wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1140' height='642' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSy5KyrcPFM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Create an SEO strategy</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Forget what you think you know about <a href="https://www.cairocorps.com/seo-in-digital-marketing/">SEO</a> and start thinking about it as an ever-evolving field.

So when it comes to SEO, you really can’t “set it and forget it.” You need to be monitoring and tracking how well everything is working so you’re always one step ahead of the competition.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="2000" height="744" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?fit=2000%2C744&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="best seo services in bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?resize=300%2C112&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?resize=768%2C286&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?resize=1024%2C381&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?resize=1140%2C424&amp;ssl=1 1140w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/digi6.png?resize=600%2C223&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few points you need to consider when working out an SEO strategy:</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Who is in your target market? </strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">SEO today is not about just grabbing as much traffic as possible, but instead attracting high-value visitors interested in what you offer. In terms of demographics, what is your market searching for? How are they performing web searches? Where are they located? The more specific your answers, the more valuable your investments in SEO become. <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google Analytics</a> is a good place to start your investigations!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Most people search on mobile devices</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">You don’t need statistics to show you that in the past few years the online mobile market has exploded, overtaking desktops years ago. Optimizing websites for mobile browsers is critical if you want to rank well in search engine results pages. If you’re unsure how your website measures up, enter your site’s URL in <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test</a>.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Search engines are expanding</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">When someone mentions search engines, do you automatically assume they’re talking about Google? The tech giant has such a big share of the market that ‘Googling’ has become a verb. However, a significant portion of searches takes place on alternative sites, such as Microsoft’s Bing. Make a point to search for your site on Google alternatives to see where you rank. Just improving social media engagement and adding meta tags might be all it takes to boost you a couple ranks on Bing.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1001" height="324" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seo-company-in-bangalore.jpg?fit=1001%2C324&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="seo company in bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seo-company-in-bangalore.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seo-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seo-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seo-company-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C194&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What’s your audience searching for?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Just a few years ago, the average user didn’t trust search engines to understand conversational questions. They were searching with clunky phrases like “flower delivery new york.” Now people feel comfortable typing in things like “who delivers roses near me?” Changes in searcher habits are usually subtle but will affect which keywords will be most valuable for your site. Instead of focusing on keywords that get you more traffic, focus on those that translate into conversions, revenue, and profits.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Simple navigation reigns and quality content is king</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">A user-friendly website, with interesting and easy-to-find information, is what will boost your traffic. Each page needs to be built around keyword themes, with unique content, so search engines can easily index yours and rank you higher. Positive behaviors from site visitors are your best bet for a better ranking, so keep the content natural and focused; avoid jargon and keyword stuffing to keep users from leaving the site unhappy and hurting its ranking.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Links to your site are extremely valuable</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">When another website links to yours, search engines consider that an indicator that your site contains valuable content. Not so long ago, getting dozens of links from low-quality sites was all it took to boost your ranking. Today, the value of a link to your site depends on the quality of the site that linked to you. Just a few links to your business from high-traffic sites will do wonders for your ranking!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Social media has a pivotal role</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, social media is an evolving platform that has changed from a basic communication platform to a highly profitable marketing channel. Many users start their searches on social media and make their way to a business’s site. Sharing up-to-date, engaging, and personalized content will attract more people to your profile, and eventually to your website.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The analysis is the key to SEO</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Monitoring your ranking on search engines is key to getting better results. Start by tracking the most important website metrics to set a baseline for your performance. Make small content changes and see if you notice a boost in your site traffic or rankings. Avoid making several unrelated changes simultaneously so you can always keep track of what was responsible for improved performance.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="900" height="280" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seocompanies-in-bangalore.jpg?fit=900%2C280&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="seo companies in bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seocompanies-in-bangalore.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seocompanies-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seocompanies-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C239&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/seocompanies-in-bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C187&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve discussed some of the core components of a successful SEO campaign.
