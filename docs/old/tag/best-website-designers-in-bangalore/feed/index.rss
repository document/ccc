They are the one who created the device-adaptive website. It was launched in 2001. After 2011 the developer Ethan Marcotte use the same type of technology and phase it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Responsive Web Design</a>, Marcotte wrote a book on the subject in 2011 simply titled “Responsive Web Design.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">8-Important Benefits of Responsive Web Design</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays everyone has a mobile in their hand, They were getting everything from there.
