While <a href="https://www.cairocorps.com/seo-in-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> is an important channel, the ROI that can come from improving customer conversion rates on your website can’t be beaten — assuming you actually have people coming to your website in the first place.</p><p><span id="more-4331"></span></p></div></div><div class="wpb_video_widget wpb_content_element vc_clearfix   vc_video-aspect-ratio-169 vc_video-el-width-100 vc_video-align-left"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="wpb_video_wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1140' height='642' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSy5KyrcPFM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">1.  Put Your Phone Number At The Top Of Every Page In Big Font</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sounds obvious, right? But, millions of sites don’t do this. According to <a class="broken_link" href="http://www.biakelsey.com/company/press-releases/120416-Less-Than-20-Percent-of-SMB-Websites-Link-to-Social-Presence,-According-to-SMB-DigitalScape.asp">a report by VSplash</a>, “<em>six out of ten SMB websites in the U.S. are missing either a local or toll-free telephone number on the home page to contact the business</em>.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Small business owners are always talking about how they want “calls not clicks.” Put your phone number in people’s faces. That might help.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1101" height="469" src="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?fit=1101%2C469&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="SEO services in bangalore, SEO-Company-Bangalore" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?w=1101&amp;ssl=1 1101w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?resize=1024%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-Company-Bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C256&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1101px) 100vw, 1101px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">2.  Understand Your Customer’s Objectives</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Many small and local business websites are a home page with some kind of “welcome” message and/or marketing text, an image or two, and a couple of tabs — usually <em>Services, About, Contact</em>, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Your business likely has a variety of different types of customers who are looking for different things, and when they land on any page of your website, it should be crystal clear how to find what they are looking for immediately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is no easy task, particularly for large websites with lots of content. A recent example I looked at was a veterinarian site that just had <em>Services</em>, <em>Contact</em> and <em>Events</em> tabs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While it’s not rocket science for a visitor to click on the <em>Services</em> tab to find that the vet provides services for horses, providing navigation that prominently identifies the animal types the vet works with would help. Navigation links like <em>Dogs</em>, <em>Cats</em>, <em>Horses</em>, <em>Duckbill Platypus</em>, etc. are much more likely to be of interest to people with sick pets than your next street fair appearance.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="post-content"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">3.  Create Content That Focuses On Your Customers’ Needs</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll find this one repeated everywhere there is a search marketing guru, but it’s perhaps one of the most effective things you can do to bring qualified leads to your website with the hopes of converting them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Offline, when you are selling a customer, you do it by answering common questions, telling them how you do things, providing them with pricing and timing information, etc. It’s no different with your website.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In our above Vet example, perhaps the site could explain how they deal with the typical Duckbill Platypus maladies. If you’re at a loss for content ideas for your site, consult<a href="http://cairocorps.com/contact-us/"> How To Create Content When You’d Rather Be Doing Something Else.</a></p></div></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="978" height="350" src="https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-services-in-Bangalore.png?fit=978%2C350&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="SEO services in Bangalore, seo agency bangalore" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-services-in-Bangalore.png?w=978&amp;ssl=1 978w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-services-in-Bangalore.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-services-in-Bangalore.png?resize=768%2C275&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-services-in-Bangalore.png?resize=600%2C215&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">4.  Don’t Use Clip Art!</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">You’re a cheap guy, right? That’s how you’ve become overlord of your vast SMB empire. But, just because you are cheap doesn’t mean your website has to look cheap (unless, of course, that is what your brand is all about, such as,<em> Cheap Harry’s Auto Repair</em>).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Use of clip art is a serious offense. There are plenty of inexpensive design services that can supply you with decent-looking artwork for your site. Try <a href="http://www.odesk.com/" class="broken_link">ODesk</a>, <a href="http://www.elance.com/" class="broken_link">Elance</a>, <a href="http://99designs.com/">99Designs</a> or better yet, the local high school art class.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can always upload a nice photo, too. Show your company vehicles and your location. Maybe show yourself or your employees at work. People want to do business with people, not clip-art models, and definitely not with that chick sitting on the floor with a laptop raising both arms in triumph. Can we please just retire her?</p></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">5.  Add Testimonials</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Potential customers want to see that other human beings find your services valuable. Adding a few quotes from happy customers can do a lot to help sell people on your service. Just make sure they are real quotes. If you don’t have any, grab some from a third-party review site like Yelp, which leads us to the need for trust.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="877" height="302" src="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-Bangalore.png?fit=877%2C302&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="SEO agency in Bangalore, top SEO company in bangalore" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-Bangalore.png?w=877&amp;ssl=1 877w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-Bangalore.png?resize=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-Bangalore.png?resize=768%2C264&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-Bangalore.png?resize=600%2C207&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 877px) 100vw, 877px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">6.  Add Trust Marks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Just like testimonials, trust marks — logos from services that provide some kind of validation of how good or trustworthy a business is — can go a long way toward helping someone, who has never heard of you before, feel good about making a purchase on your site, sending you an email or picking up the phone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Logos from organizations like the BBB, the local business association, or even the local soccer league will do the trick.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">7.  Add Conversion Messages To Your Landing Pages (And All Your Pages)</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For each page on your site, you would ideally craft conversion messages relevant to the content (e.g., <em>“Is Your Duckbill Platypus Sick</em>? <em>Call Us Now</em>!”). You may even want to test putting a “contact us for a free estimate” message in front of visitors that request the content using a lightbox type pop-up approach. One client increased inbound leads by 300% just using this simple technique.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1350" height="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?fit=1350%2C450&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="SEO agency in Bangalore, best seo services in Bangalore" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?w=1350&amp;ssl=1 1350w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?resize=1140%2C380&amp;ssl=1 1140w, https://i1.wp.com/cairocorps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SEO-agency-in-Bangalore.jpg?resize=600%2C200&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: left;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">8.  Qualify Your Visitors</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">I love sites that take visitors through a simple set of questions designed to segment them (e.g., budget, nature of their problem, timing, size of their company, title, location, etc.). This method can help you push the visitor to the right content, product, salesperson, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While it could also reduce the number of inbound leads, those leads that come in should be of much higher quality because they’ve been qualified</p></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27">9.  Keep Your Address, Hours &amp; Event Calendars Up To Date</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Goes without saying right?

If your site converts 1% of all visitors, you make $1 for every visitor that shows up. Double that to 2% and you make $2. If it costs you $1,000 to get to 2%, the improvements will pay for themselves after 500 visitors. Everything after that is gravy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you had invested that same $1,000 in SEO instead and conversion stayed at 1%, you would need to get 1,000 additional visitors from SEO to break even. And while good SEO can last for a while, inevitably you would have to keep reinvesting in it over time to maintain the traffic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll want to keep reinvesting in improving conversion optimization too; but like I said, the ROI will be much more immediate. And, who doesn’t like that? Now, go fix that crappy site already. It’s just embarrassing.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com/10-tips-improve-smb-websites-seo/">10 Tips To Improve SMB Websites Before SEO</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com">CairoCorps Consulting</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://cairocorps.com/10-tips-improve-smb-websites-seo/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <post-id xmlns="com-wordpress:feed-additions:1">4331</post-id> </item> <item><title>Why Is Website Important For SMB?</title><link>https://cairocorps.com/why-is-website-important-for-smb/</link> <comments>https://cairocorps.com/why-is-website-important-for-smb/#respond</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:55:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas Julier]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Website]]></category> <category><![CDATA[smb]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.cairocorps.com/?p=4327</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com/why-is-website-important-for-smb/">Why Is Website Important For SMB?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com">CairoCorps Consulting</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="vc_row section-wrapper"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner vc_custom_1529484810470"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><p style="text-align: justify;">If you have just started a small business, or if you have one and want to take it to the next level sometime in the not-so-distant future, you should be thinking about a website. A website has become such a common part of a business plan nowadays, in the age of technological advances and tablets being everywhere, that small business needs to consider enhancing the means through which a customer can find their brand.</p><p><span id="more-4327"></span></p></div></div><div class="wpb_video_widget wpb_content_element vc_clearfix   vc_video-aspect-ratio-169 vc_video-el-width-100 vc_video-align-left"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="wpb_video_wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1140' height='642' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSy5KyrcPFM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></div></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2 style="text-align: justify;" data-fontsize="21" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Does an SMB really need a website?</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It depends on the goal if we’re being honest. If the goal is to stay where they are and maybe go back a little bit each year, then a website is not necessary. Can you see where this is going? Having a business strategy that involves building a website is becoming the norm, and the good news about it is that a website helps businesses reach more customers than word of mouth ever could.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is not to say that small business need something that costs millions. A good simple website can be cheap to build and maintain, and it can bring in noticeably larger revenues to a business, thanks to the website’s ability to reach out to new potential buyers.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="576" height="268" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Important-Tips-for-Your-Sma.jpg?fit=576%2C268&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="best web design company in Bangalore, web design company in bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Important-Tips-for-Your-Sma.jpg?w=576&amp;ssl=1 576w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Important-Tips-for-Your-Sma.jpg?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><p><strong>Personal touch</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many of those who start out in the world of websites are scared- and understandably so- by the fact that their business was built by having direct contact with people, and they fear that the World Wide Web is going to take that away. While this is a common idea, it is a misconception. A website will be people’s way to find you, and the contact (and business) can continue in the offline world. The website can be used as an access door that gets the client into your shop, so to say.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from this, a small business owner will be aware of their brand image- and this particular brand image can be the one that attracts people to their business, on a personal level. A toy store with a website that is bright (for kids) but easy to navigate (for parents) will bring in customers through the website, just as a notary office will find new clients through their neat and organized website that clearly lists what paperwork you will need for your particular request.</p></div></div><div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_left"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"><div class="vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey"><img width="1920" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?fit=1920%2C600&amp;ssl=1" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="websites design in bangalore, web design company in Bangalore" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?resize=768%2C240&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?resize=1024%2C320&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?resize=1140%2C356&amp;ssl=1 1140w, https://i2.wp.com/cairocorps.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/web2.jpg?resize=600%2C188&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></div> </figure></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3><strong>Not selling online</strong></h3><p>Many SMB owners claim that they do not sell products online, and this is the reason to not have a website.

But they will use the Internet to see what the closest store is to them, what time they open and close, and if they help with the delivery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, a website can be your strongest asset in the modern world. It can show who you are, how successful you are, what your company has to offer, and when the new client is hooked, it can show them how to get to you. So consider the website an investment, like an ad in the paper, which keeps refreshing itself day after day, helping people connect with your business.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com/why-is-website-important-for-smb/">Why Is Website Important For SMB?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cairocorps.com">CairoCorps Consulting</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://cairocorps.com/why-is-website-important-for-smb/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> <post-id xmlns="com-wordpress:feed-additions:1">4327</post-id> </item> </channel> </rss>
