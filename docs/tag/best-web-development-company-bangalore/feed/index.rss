Responsive designs are giving more attractive to the dynamic websites. Its suitable for all devices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone Should know the <a href="https://www.cairocorps.com/benefits-of-responsive-web-design-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of responsive web design</a>.

The website shows the brand name of your startup so it must impress the guests. A simple website without unnecessary distractions is less overwhelming, particularly for first-time guests.

If it isn’t loaded within 3 seconds, users lead to abandoning the respective website. That indicates you’re not only losing your current guests and reducing conversion rates, though you run the risk of your website losing traffic from those customers who may have referred your website to others.
